### Hi there 👋

Do you want to know more about me?

👇

🧑‍🎓 Student in Computer Sciences (currently Master 1) [Aix-Marseille Université (AMU)](https://www.univ-amu.fr/) and [Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB)](https://github.com/ulb).

📜 Master : Mathématiques & Applications (Mention préparation à l'agrégation) at Aix-Marseille Université. 

🧑‍💻 Core Team Developer for [Juneo](https://github.com/Juneo-io) (a new blockchain forked from Avalanche).

🤝 Steward and coder for [DAO Brussels](https://github.com/daobrussels) (Experiment DAO technology together [manifesto](https://dao.brussels/manifesto)).

🧠 [Smart Monday](urlab.be/events/talks) speaker supervisor for [URLab](https://github.com/UrLab) (Student Hackerspace of ULB).

🔭 Making [research](https://github.com/tsua0002/blockchain_research) about Blockchain with the goal to create a PhD for next year about Blokchain technology.

💭 Today, blockchain technology is hyped and not a lot of qualitative academic research exist. **I want to change it!** I want to participate into the next wave of **academic and fundamental research about Blockchain**. Blockchain for now, is often considered and regarded from its cryptographic components. But the technology can allow much more!! Cf what I do. 
👉 Use cases: data, automated transactions, communication (with open ledger as Bitcoin or Ethereum), votes and much more. This shouldn't be considered by academic research?
