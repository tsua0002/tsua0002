### Hi there 👋


What I'm doing now 👇

👷 Building agents and work with #MCP (Model Context Protocol) to implement complex agentic architecture

📝 Writing Bitcoin Tech news and French translation on my LinkedIn

🤝 Steward and coder/vibe-coder for [DAO Brussels](https://github.com/daobrussels) (Experiment DAO technology together [manifesto](https://dao.brussels/manifesto)).

🔭 Making [research](https://github.com/tsua0002/blockchain_research) about Blockchain, focus on Bitcoin since 2 years with the goal to craft a serious PhD topic about Bitcoin Inscriptions. 

💭 Today, Bitcoin is at the core thinking of more and more processes but not a lot of people are learning and doing research about it, me I do. Do your homework, Read The Fucking Manual.
