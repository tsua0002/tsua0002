# 👋 Hi, I'm Thomas Suau

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a researcher, builder, speaker, and advisor focused on **Bitcoin**, **AI Agents**, **fundamental mathematics**, and **philosophy**. With a strong academic background in mathematics and computer science, I craft tools, explore protocol design, and contribute to the evolving stack at the intersection of **Bitcoin**, **automation**, and **open collaboration**.

## 🔬 Current Focus

### 🧠 Bitcoin Research & Blockchain Infrastructure
- In-depth research on **Bitcoin Inscriptions**, **Ordinals**, and **protocol evolution**.[research topic openning]()
- Maintaining a [Bitcoin research repository](https://github.com/tsua0002/bitcoin_research) focused on Bitcoin’s socio-technical dynamics.
- Publishing **technical insights** and **French translations** of Bitcoin-focused content via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-suau-92932889/).

### 🤖 AI Agents & Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Building autonomous agents with a focus on Multi-agents architecture. *What is the nature of such objects? Which space is it creating? How to think the security into such systems?*
- Deploying agents across **X (Twitter)**, **Discord**, and **Bitcoin** for community management and wallet tracking using [Cypher-swarm](https://github.com/KingBootoshi/cypher-swarm) and [lasereyes](https://)
- Exploring **swarm intelligence** and **mixture-of-agent architectures** to support complex reasoning and coordination systems.

## 👨‍💻 Open to Opportunities

I'm currently looking for:
- 🧠 **Bitcoin-first missions** focused on research, infrastructure, or protocol-level development  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Teaching or mentoring roles** in computer science, blockchain, or mathematics  
- 🧩 **Advisory roles** for Bitcoin-focused startups, protocols, or research collectives  
- 🤖 Select **R&D roles in agentic systems**, especially where they intersect with Bitcoin infrastructure

Let’s build the next chapter of open, sovereign computation.

## 🧭 Why Bitcoin Matters

> _"Bitcoin is not just a financial tool — it's a paradigm shift in how we think about **trust**, **coordination**, and **digital permanence**."_

I see the **Bitcoin protocol** as one of the most important inventions of our time — a sovereign, censorship-resistant foundation for digital truth, economic freedom, and decentralized coordination. It represents **a machine for civilizational continuity**, capable of surviving political regimes, infrastructure decay, and human error.

Bitcoin is not just the beginning of digital money — it is the start of a broader transformation in how we verify and transmit value. Its resilience and composability invite us to explore use cases far beyond speculation.

**Autonomous agents**, when built to interact with Bitcoin, can unlock **dormant layers of functionality** that are too technically complex or rigid for average users to leverage today. Combining Bitcoin’s permanence with agents' flexibility creates new frontiers in permissionless coordination, economic expression, and long-term data assurance.

## 📚 Use Cases I Explore

- Data integrity and reproducibility in scientific and institutional research  
- Trust-minimized governance and on-chain voting architectures  
- Agent-driven decentralized organizations (DAOs / ADOs)  
- Semantic indexing and enhanced query layers over Bitcoin Inscriptions  
- Protocol evolution with **Covenants**, **BitVM**, and Bitcoin scripting extensions  
- Autonomous reasoning protocols powered by **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  
- Swarm intelligence and **mixture-of-agent architectures** for distributed inference  
- Active research on the **state-of-the-art in Agentics**, with applications in open infrastructure and digital sovereignty
